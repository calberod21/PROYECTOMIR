## Description

A set of tools to analyze and visualize Music Information Retrieval algorithms over Pop-Music Audio signals.

This Source is organized as follows:

1) The principal Graphic user interface (GUI), GUI_UNIAJC_MIR.m/fig, has four buttons addressing to four MIR modules: Tonal, Beat Tracking, Chord Recognition, and Melody Recognition. 

2) Each module resides in its own folder, however resources are shared from the same folders such as Resources folder and MIRLib folder.

3) Resource folder contains icons and images for all the GUI's.

4) MIRLib folder has basic functions for MIR algorithm implementations. General [Audio Content Analysis] (http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/), [Chroma Calculations] (http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/rosa/matlab/chroma-ansyn/) and [Beat tracking] (http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/coversongs/) libraries have been downloaded and adapted for this project.
